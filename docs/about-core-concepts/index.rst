The Open Data Cube (ODC) is an open source solution for accessing, managing, and analyzing large quantities of Geographic Information System (GIS) data - namely Earth observation (EO) data.

The ODC presents a common analytical framework composed of a series of data structures and tools which facilitate the organization and analysis of large gridded data collections. The Open Data Cube was developed for the analysis of temporally-rich earth observation data, however the flexibility of the platform also allows other gridded data collections to be included and analyzed. Such data may include elevation models, geophysical grids, interpolated surfaces and model outputs.

A key characteristic of the Open Data Cube is that every unique observation is kept, which contrasts with many other methods used to handle large gridded data collections. Some of the major advantages of ODC are the following:

- Flexible framework
- User maintains control and ownership over their data
- Paradigm shift from scene-based analysis to pixel based
- Lower barrier to entry for remote sensing data analysis.

In this section, we briefly describe and illustrate the high-level architecture and ecosystem of the ODC framework in order to provide a better understanding to those who are new to ODC. This document only covers major components of the ODC and the relationships between them.
